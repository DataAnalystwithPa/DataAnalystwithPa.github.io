## Study Objective

Our study focuses on investigating the correlation between education duration and happiness levels. We utilized two separate datasets obtained from Kaggle for this analysis:

1. **Gallup World Survey Dataset:**
   - This dataset includes country-specific joy scores and rankings obtained from the Gallup World Survey.
   - The evaluations are conducted using the Cantril step and consider multiple factors influencing life assessments. These factors include economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.

2. **Average Years of Schooling Dataset:**
   - This dataset is centered on the average years of schooling across different years for each country.

The combined analysis of these datasets aims to explore and understand the potential relationship between the duration of education and levels of happiness in various countries.

## Introduction/Background

As students invested in education, understanding the relationship between education and happiness is personally relevant to everyone on our team. Our research question is: Is there a correlation between a country’s average years of schooling and its happiness score? It goes beyond academic curiosity. It’s about assessing the value of our investment in education, not just in economic terms but in terms of quality of life and happiness.

By examining datasets on happiness scores and average years of schooling, our study delves into how education might influence a country’s overall wellbeing. This approach offers a novel perspective in happiness research, typically dominated by economic and social factors like income and social support. Our focus on education as a potential contributor to happiness adds a new dimension to understanding what makes societies thrive.

The World Happiness Report provides each country with a Happiness Score which is calculated from the following factors: GDP per capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, Social Support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, and Corruption Perception. Due to the broad range of contributing factors, we believe the Happiness Score to be a fair indicator of a country’s average happiness for our study.

## Methodology

In our methodology, we initiated our study by dealing with the vast amount of data available across multiple years in both datasets. To streamline our analysis, we decided to focus solely on data spanning from 2015 to 2017 from both the "World Happiness" dataset and the education dataset. Our initial step involved a meticulous data cleaning process for the "World Happiness" dataset, where we eliminated countries lacking data for all three years and identified and corrected any discrepancies in country names occurring across these years.

Subsequently, we merged the cleaned "World Happiness" dataset with the education dataset, cross-referencing countries to ensure data consistency between the two. This step was crucial in aligning the datasets based on the corresponding years of collection. Following the completion of the data cleaning process for both datasets, our next phase included merging them based on the years in which the data was collected. This merging process aimed to effectively combine the education and happiness data, ensuring they were synchronized by the respective collection years.

Upon successful merging, we applied a series of statistical tests, including determining the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each variable (such as GDP per capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Corruption Perception, Residual error, and years of school). Additionally, we conducted correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and interaction analysis. These tests were crucial in our investigation to ascertain whether significant differences existed between the duration of education and the ranking of happiness.

### Statistical Test

To initiate our statistical examination, we calculated the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for various variables such as GDP per capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Corruption Perception, Residual error, and years of school. Excel was utilized to derive these values for each variable, and the resulting computations are depicted in the accompanying image.

### Correlation Analysis

In our correlation analysis, we employed RStudio as our tool of choice to conduct the correlation test. The following section presents the code utilized for executing the test within RStudio, alongside the detailed results derived from this analysis.

This code performs a correlation test between the variables “Avg Years of Schooling” and “Happiness Score“ from the dataset CombinedReports_draft_1 using the cor.test() function in R. Specifically, the cor.test() function computes the correlation coefficient between “Avg Years of Schooling” and “Happiness Score”, as well as conducts a hypothesis test to determine if there is a significant correlation between the two variables. The correlation coefficient provides information on the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables (whether they move together positively, negatively, or are unrelated).

### Hypothesis Testing

In our quest to analyze our dataset thoroughly, we opted to conduct a hypothesis test using a regression model. This test was designed to explore and assess the potential relationship between the happiness score and the average years of schooling. The method involved implementing a specific code snippet as an integral part of our analytical process. The code utilized for this analysis is presented below:

The code initiates the creation of a linear regression model (denoted as model1) within the dataset CombinedReports_draft_1. This model aims to examine the relationship between the dependent variable, "Happiness Score," and the independent variable, "Avg Years of Schooling." Utilizing the lm() function, this code creates a linear model to predict the "Happiness Score" based on the "Avg Years of Schooling" variable. Subsequently, employing the summary() function generates a comprehensive summary output.

This summary provides statistical insights into model1, facilitating a better understanding of the correlation between "Avg Years of Schooling" and "Happiness Score." It assesses the strength of this relationship within the dataset.

### Interaction Analysis

In embracing our interaction analysis, we adopted a methodical approach similar to our previous hypothesis testing techniques. However, to explore into the complexities of potential interactions, we utilized a comparable approach, utilizing the Linear Regression model as we had in earlier analyses. In this instance, we opted to utilize SAP software, a choice tailored to produce graphical representations aiding in the visualization of potential interactions. Considering the multifaceted nature of our `Happiness Score`, influenced by multiple variables such as GDP per capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Corruption Perception, and Residual error, we made a deliberate choice to examine interactions between these variables and the duration spent on schooling. This decision was motivated by our quest to comprehensively understand how the years dedicated to education might interact with these essential aspects contributing to overall well-being.

## Results

Following a thorough execution of multiple tests, an extensive examination was undertaken to comprehensively analyze the obtained results. Each test was subjected to a comprehensive review to identify potential trends or patterns within the data. Presented below are the findings, highlighting significant observations and correlations discovered through this meticulous analysis.

### Statistical Test Outcome

Upon calculating the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for all variables, a noticeable trend emerged: over the years, there was an increase in the Happiness score, GDP per capita, generosity, and average years of schooling. Conversely, there was a decrease observed in Health (Life expectancy), trust (government corruption), and Dystopia Residual over the same period. Among the remaining variables, fluctuations of increase and decrease were noted across the three years. These findings prompt further analysis, indicating a need to conduct individual tests on each variable. Notably, not all variables exhibit similar correlations, especially those demonstrating fluctuations between the three years. It is evident that additional tests are
